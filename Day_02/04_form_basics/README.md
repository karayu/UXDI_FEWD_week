####Instructional Design Notes

Students always struggle with how to start. They spend the first 30 min of lab time, pondering what to do first. Help them take those first steps. 

*	If you were given the fashion blog site part 1, what is the first thing  you would do. 

*	Think about that process and how you would teach someone to do the same. 

*	Spend 10 minutes guiding students through that process of where and how students should start the exercise. Direct students by giving them the skills to re create a web page from an image.

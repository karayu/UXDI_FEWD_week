##Week 7 - Day 05: Review, Q+A, and Resources

Students have just finished Front-End week! This day is an opportunity to wrap up any projects, ask the instructor questions, and explore additional front-end resources.

###Morning Session

The morning session should be used to debrief the lesson learned that week, and give students an opportunity to ask questions around the concepts they struggled with the most. 

If you wrap up Q+A early, students can use that time to work on portfolios.

####Instructional Design Notes

*	This is an ambitious site to build at the end of the week. The goal is to encourage students to divide and conquer. We want to teach them how to look at a [png file](starter_code/startup_matchmaker/StartupMatchmaker.png) determine the sections that are needed and then code. 

*	Ask groups to plan and determine where they should start. They should follow the same process you taught them. 

*	For the advanced students, there are 2 additional pages (developers & designers) they can code.

__Please note that students will need to Google:__

*	background-image
*	```<del>``` ```<ins>```
*	overflow

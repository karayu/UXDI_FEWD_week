| Time        | Topic| GA Resources | Comments |
| ------------- |:-------------|:-------------------|:----------------|
| 60 min |Introduction to Web Development| [Lesson Deck](https://drive.google.com/a/generalassemb.ly/file/d/0B9Aus64Bu_fOMm1yb2g0TFdzcVU/edit?usp=sharing)| This section relies on a Keynote 2013 deck located in the UXDI Google Drive directory. A Keynote 2009 version is also available in the same folder.|
| 10 min | Setting Up Your Environment | [Lesson Deck](https://drive.google.com/a/generalassemb.ly/file/d/0B9Aus64Bu_fOMm1yb2g0TFdzcVU/edit?usp=sharing)| Make sure to guide students through this process, and walk around the classroom to ensure that every student has successfully set up their environment. |
| 60 min |HTML Tags & Using Sublime| [GA Press Release](solution/ga_press_release)| Basic site to demonstrate html files and tags. This is another opportunity to show students how to use sublime text. This will make sure everyone is up to speed and ready to move forward.|
| 30 min | Code Along | [Cookies Recipe](solution/cookie_recipe) | Students add tags to a Cookie recipe and start to "markup" their resume. |

## [GA Press Release](solution/ga_press_release)

###Time: 20 min

| | |
| ------------- |:-------------|
| __Topics__ | HTML Tags, nesting| 
| __Description__| This is an exercise to show students basic HTML tags.|   
|__Activity Type__| Code Along | 
 
 
####Instructional Design Notes

*	See a [suggestion](solution/ga_press_release/instr_notes.md) of how to implement this code along from our curriculum fellow.

*	Attach meaning to tags and show students how to approach content. 

*	This introductory exercise is meant to highlight HTML tag patterns so students can look up other tags. 

Pattern examples: 

*	It starts with an opening tag and ends with a closing tag.
	*	__Exception__: Only tags which don't need to close are those which contain no nested content? That is, img, input, br, hr, etc (nested content could include text and text according to JS is a node in and of itself).

*	Some tags require an attribute (we will cover img tags next class) 

*	Hierarchy of tags. (H1 is going to be bigger than h2)

*	Tags describe the content. 




Note: Omit ordered list ```<ol>```, students will Google it during lab time.

Remember to share the [starter_code](starter_code/) folder at the beginning of class. Share code_along solutions before lab time so students have an example to reference. 


##[Chocolate Chip Cookie Recipe](solution/cookie_recipe)

####Time: 20 min

| | |
| ------------- |:-------------|
| __Topics__ | html tags| 
| __Description__| Students add markup to a chocolate chip cookie recipe. This also serves as a time to practice using web dev tools (sublime, chrome, finder etc)|    
| __Activity Type__| Code Along | 


####Instructional Design Notes 

*	The starter code contains an html file with a recipe for cookies and a png of the final product. Students will add HTML tags to make the page look like the .png. Students are required to google and implement the```<ol>``` tag. Highlight  the ol tag on the .png file ask students to Google how to use it.

*	Bonus: Students can Google and implement the image tag. We will cover image tags next lesson.

##Week 7 - Lesson 3: Advanced CSS & Layout


###Learning Objectives

*	Define CSS Box Model, and demonstrate the ability to properly manipulate the "box" around tags.

*	Differentiate between classes vs IDs and apply best practices when implementing.

*	Select nested elements to apply styling. 
*	Draw the DOM Tree for web pages containing sections ```<div><section>```.

*	Apply header, footer, sidebar, and multi-column layouts to develop a web page.

*	Experiment and predict effects of floats and clearing CSS positioning.

*	Describe the use of Normalize and reset.css files.


###Schedule


| Time        | Topic| GA ICLs| Comments |
| ------------- |:-------------|:-------------------|:----------------|
| 15 min | Review| | Review topics students may be struggling with. We found that student need more practice with absolute versus relative paths.|
| 50 min | Box Model| [Box Model]() |  |
| 20 min | Nested Selectors | [Nested Selectors]() |  |
| 30 min| Classes, IDs, Divs| [Classes_Ids]()| |
| 20 min |HTML5 structural elements | [Floating Sections]() | Some basic HTML5 structural elements (header, aside, footer)|
| 50 min | Floats| [Floating Sections]() | We use the structural elements and float them on th page. |

##[Box Model](http://codepen.io/nevan/pen/vtorn)

###Time: 30 min

| | |
| ------------- |:-------------|
| __Topics__ | margin, padding, box model | 
| __Description__| A code example to help explain box model. |   
| __Activity Type__| Code along | 
 

####Instructional Design Notes

*	This code along is in code pen because it is easy to share. When building in class you should use .html and .css files so student become comfortable with using their computer.

*	In this example we use familiar tags to teach students about the box model. 

*	In the following example we will show students classes and ids and how the box model applies. 

*	During the code along check for understanding by asking students "what if" type questions.



##[Nested Selectors](http://codepen.io/nevan/pen/gFAfh)


###Time: 20 min

| | |
| ------------- |:-------------|
| __Topics__ | selectors, blockquotes, nesting | 
| __Description__| Students practice selecting elements that are nested. The code pen exercise uses loreum hipster text but you can choose to use another piece of text. |   
| __Activity Type__| Code along.| 
 
 
####Instructional Design Notes

Students often struggle with selecting elements on the page that are nested between other tags. 

*	This code along is in code pen because it is easy to share. When building in class you should use .html and .css files so student become comfortable with using their computer.

*	This code along is used to demonstrate how to select specific elements on the page. Ask student how they would select a specific p tag that is nested in another. They should be able to infer answers based on what they've seen in previous lessons.

*	You can draw a DOM tree on the white board to help with understanding.

## [Classes_IDs](http://codepen.io/nevan/pen/JnfEd)


###Time: 30 min

| | |
| ------------- |:-------------|
| __Topics__ | divs, classes, ids | 
| __Description__| sandbox type activity to show how and when to use Classes and Is |   
| __Activity Type__| code along| 
 

####Instructional Design Notes

*	When explaining classes and IDs it is important to tell students, when to use classes and when to use ids. The code along highlights this.


## [Floating Sections](http://codepen.io/nevan/pen/nHIEo)


###Time: 60 min

| | |
| ------------- |:-------------|
| __Topics__ | header, aside, footer, floats | 
| __Description__| sandbox activity to demonstrate floats and structural elements. |   
| __Activity Type__| code along | 
  

####Instructional Design Notes

*	This is a barebones example so we can isolate floats and structural elements. 

*	Students will transfer what they learn here and apply it to the fashion blog. 

*	To help students understand how this sandbox code along would apply to a real site, show them floating elements on a real web page. You will need to teach students how to identify content sections on a web page in order for them to be able to successfully apply floats during lab time.

*	This is also a good time to refer to the DOM tree.

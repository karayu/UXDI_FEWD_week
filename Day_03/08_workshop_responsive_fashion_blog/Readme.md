| __Activity Type__| group exercise| 


####Instructional Design Notes 

*	Give students 10 min to determine what divs, classes and ids they require to build the Fashion Blog. 

*	Instructors have found it helpful to provide black and white printouts of the final page and ask students to draw boxes around content they think should be grouped together as a div. 
	*	Once students have identified sections, ask them to determine which boxes/divs should have a class or id. Encourage students to look for similarities to determine what should be a class. 

*	After 10 min share your answers of how the site should be sectioned. They will use this to code.
